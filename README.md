# Hyperbolic-Tangent-Activation
The code applies a numerical approximation technique using hyperbolic tangent functions to estimate an unknown function. It constructs a matrix system based on the collocation points and solves for the coefficients. The resulting approximation is then plotted alongside the exact function to visualize the accuracy of the approximation.
